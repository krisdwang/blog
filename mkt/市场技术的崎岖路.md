#Marketing Tech’s Bumpy Road: Consolidation, Growth And A New Frontier
#营销技术的崎岖之路：巩固、成长和新的领域

Marketing technology has become big business over the last five years, securing $134 billion in venture funding and spawning more than 2,000 new companies. New channels, new data streams and new workflow have emerged to disrupt important aspects of marketing at big and small companies alike. And CMOs are buying — roughly $23 billion in 2015, according to IDC, and likely growing to $32.4 billion in 2018.

在过去五年中，营销技术已经成为大规模商业行为，汇集了[1340亿美金的风险投资](http://venturebeat.com/2015/12/31/martech-in-2015-17b-in-funding-87b-in-exits-and-more-fragmented-than-ever/)，并且催生了超过2000家新的公司。新渠道、新数据流和新工作流程的出现打破了营销领域的重要方面，对于大公司和小公司来说都是如此。根据IDC的报告，首席营销官们在2015年的购买行为按照粗略的统计大约为230亿美金，并有可能在2018年[增长到324亿美金](http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS25209414)。

So why is the mood in martech so bleak? I’ve seen dozens of articles in the last few months expressing pessimism about the state of martech in 2016. Many investors and entrepreneurs are lamenting how crowded and fragmented the sector is, arguing that it’s overfunded with too many point products. Others have pointed out that sales force automation produced a $50 billion company in Salesforce.com, yet marketing automation has produced only a few public companies collectively worth less than $5 billion.

那么，为什么对于营销技术的心情如此黯淡？在过去的几个月，我阅读了许多对于营销技术在2016年的状态表达悲观情绪的文章。投资人和企业主都在感叹这个行业的喧嚣和碎片化，争论在太多产品点上的过度投资。其它则指出销售自动化产生了 salesforce.com这样的超过500亿美金的公司，而其它的行销自动化领域的上市公司市值的总和还为超过50亿美金。

Both concerns are legitimate. There are indeed too many companies fighting for limited time and attention from busier-than-ever marketers — and equally true is that martech hasn’t hit the big time for public valuations. We expect to see significant winnowing over the next few years, driven by customer choice (CMOs don’t want to buy from hundreds of vendors) and lack of funding (investors will tighten the reins on Series B and Series C investments due to the broader economic climate).

这两种担心都是合理的。确实存在很多公司为了争取有限的时间以及从忙碌的市场营销者那里获取注意而奋斗，并且营销技术并没有一个合理的有公信力的估值。我们希望看到在未来的几年中，通过客户的选择（首席营销官不想从数百家提供商中做选择）和资金的匮乏（受到大的经济环境的影响，投资者会收紧B轮和C轮投资）等方式大浪淘沙。

Regardless, I continue to be extremely optimistic about the martech opportunity, and believe someone will build a $10 billion-plus martech company. As a long-time investor in this space, I’ve seen first-hand how technology can transform sales and marketing — and empower teams with better insight, more precision and, ultimately, more predictability.

不管怎样，我对于营销技术会保持持续乐观的态度，并且相信会有超过100亿美金的营销技术公司出现。长期从事这个领域的投资，我看到了技术是如果改变销售和营销，从而使团队具有更好的洞察力、更加精确，最终更加可预测。

Moving forward, it’s important to remember that martech is not monolithic. I see very different prospects and paths ahead for the three macro categories in martech: B2B marketing, B2C marketing and advertising technology. Each has a set of characteristics and verticals and needs that are distinct from each other — and while there may be some overlap, each will require a different “stack” of software.

切记营销技术并不是铁板一块非常重要。我看到了三大类营销技术未来非常不同的视角和发展路径：B2B 营销，B2C 营销和广告技术。每个方面都有一些列的特性，垂直纵深和需求，并且区别于其它方面，尽管有些重叠，但是每一个都需要不同的软件栈。

##Advertising technology
##广告技术
Adtech has seen very few sustainable public companies — Criteo being the primary exception. Adtech’s challenges are well documented, but they fall into two buckets:
很少有广告技术公司能够持续发展， Criteo 公司是一个特例。广告技术的挑战是有据可查，但是他们陷入了两个泥潭：

*The solutions tend not to be sticky. Marketers are more than willing to switch to a new adtech solution if they can get a better return on ad spend, and they happily force vendors into annual or bi-annual head-to-head tests.

*解决方案没有粘性。为了投资能够获得更好的回报，营销人员更愿意切换到新的广告技术解决方案，他们乐于每年或者每半年强迫广告技术提供商进行对标。

*The adtech companies must contend with the power and leverage of the underlying supply platforms, primarily Google, Facebook and Apple/iOS. These underlying platforms continue to innovate and add/absorb functionality, reducing the value that adtech “middlemen” are able to provide over time.

*广告技术公司必须与底层平台供应商抗衡，它们主要是 Google,Facebook 和苹果/IOS.这些底层平台提供商不断的投入，添加和吸收功能，从而减少了广告技术中间商所能提供的价值。

The bottom line: There will be exciting companies built here, but it will be a much, much harder path to a multi-billion dollar exit.

底线是：会有令人激动的公司存在，但是通向数十亿美元的路径会越来越难。

##B2B and B2C marketing
##B2B和B2C营销

Let’s first look at Salesforce.com. While they now sell into consumer companies via the ExactTarget acquisition, their bread-and-butter business has been selling “sales force automation” solutions to medium and large companies with sales people.

我们先来看看salesforce.com. 他们通过收购ExtractTarget（云自动化营销平台）杀进了消费类公司，他们的黄油面包业务已经作为“销售自动化”解决方案已经向中大型公司销售。

The concept of managing a pipeline, opportunities and accounts is very germane to B2B companies and a small segment of B2C — where the purchase is a large, multi-step, highly considered purchase. Similarly, the marketing automation companies have all grown up selling initially into B2B. The concept of managing “leads” and nurturing them through a sales cycle and then passing on a set of leads that are “sales qualified” is again very specific to B2B companies.

管理流水线(我想这里的概念应该是销售 pipeline)，机会和账户的概念与B2B以及B2C公司的一小部分密切相关，购买行为是大型的，多步骤和需要仔细考虑的。（妈的，实在没看懂）

If you look at the P&L of a B2B business, the bulk of their “front office” spend is in sales, not in marketing. In fact, a 10:1 ratio between sales and marketing spend is pretty typical. Therefore, it’s not surprising that the market cap ratio is also 10:1 between the leading sales automation company (CRM) and the leading marketing automation companies (MKTO and HSPT).

观察一个 B2B 公司的盈亏状况，大量的成本在与销售前端部门而不是营销。实际上，销售和营销的成本为10：1往往比较典型。所以，市场上领先的自动化销售公司（CRM）和领先的自动化营销公司的资本充足率同样为10：1也就不足为奇了（MKTO and HSPT）

With all that said, B2B will continue to be a strong market for martech startups with plenty of demand from CMOs; we expect to see several new $1 billion-plus companies emerge in categories like top-of-funnel marketing, account-based marketing and predictive analytics.

综上所述，B2B公司首席运营官的大量需求会持续壮大营销技术初创公司。我们希望看到在漏斗营销、基于账户营销以及预测分析等领域中出现一些10亿美元级别的市场技术公司。

B2C marketing is fundamentally different. The P&L within B2C companies (brands, retailers, consumer financial services, travel, etc.) is the opposite ratio: 10:1 in favor of marketing. Most B2C companies don’t have large sales forces, and if they have sales people at all, they’re focused on small segments of their business (very high-end customers or a B2B channel). Therefore, the software system to support B2C marketing is the biggest prize left in the front office.

B2C 的营销有根本的区别。B2C 公司的盈亏（品牌、零售、客户金融服务、旅游等等）则与 B2B 相反，营销和销售的费用比率为10：1。大多数 B2C 公司都没有大量的销售团队，如果他们有销售人员，那么这些销售人员都集中于公司小众的业务（非常高端的客户或者 B2B 渠道）。

##New frontier: B2C system(s) of record
##新领域：B2C 系统记录

The big new opportunity and challenge for entrepreneurs is to create a system of record for B2C marketing. Historically, email was the closest thing to creating a B2C digital system of record, and the B2C software company exits (Responsys and ExactTarget) had multi-billion-dollar market caps reflecting the size of this opportunity.

对于企业主来说，最大的机遇和挑战是为B2C营销构建记录系统。从历史上来看，电子邮件是最接近创造记录的B2C数字系统，(后面不知道怎么翻译，大概的意思是 Responsys 和 ExtratTarget 公司数十亿美金的市场规模能够反映 B2C记录系统的机会)

Where does the system of record start? With the customer database. In today’s environment, the customer database captures not only people who have purchased from you, but people who have not. It includes logged-in users and non-logged-in users. It includes rich data about those customers and their households, linking purchase data with browsing history, social data and detailed demographics.

记录系统应该从什么地方开始？在当今的环境下，客户的数据库不仅捕获人们购买了什么，还能捕获没有购买什么。这包括登录和未登录的用户。这其中包含了大量的客户及其家人的信息，从而连接起购买数据与浏览历史，社交数据以及人口学数据的详情。

Historically, having one system of record that brings together Omniture website data, retail point-of-sale data, Teradata transactional data and social media data was next to impossible. Now, with advances in big data and cloud systems, the syncing of these data sources is finally feasible — and huge volumes of customer data can effectively be managed via the cloud.

过去，使用一个系统提供网站分析工具并汇集网站数据，点对点零售信息，交易数据仓库以及社交媒体数据几乎是不可能的。现今，利用大数据和云计算系统，同步这些数据最终成为可能-大量的客户数据可以通过云计算技术有效的管理。

Once the core database is in place, a true B2C system of record doesn’t stop there. A next-gen system will use machine learning and predictive technology to identify and generate dozens to hundreds of useful market segments — more actionable than the three-five segments typically derived via demographic data. It will link directly into personalization platforms like BloomReach and Optimizely to power customized and relevant experiences for each consumer. And this system will be the foundation for all forms of channel marketing, whether that is email through SendGrid, social through Sprinklr or ad-targeting through Kenshoo and Turn.

一旦核心数据库建成，一个真实的 B2C 记录系统就会成形。下一代系统将会使用机器学习，预测分析技术识别和生成成百上千的细分市场，这比起通过人口学统计数据得出的少量的部分更加有效。这个系统将成为所有形式的渠道营销的基础，无论是通过邮件（SendGrid），社交（Sprinklr）还是广告（Kenshoo 和 Turn）

The entrepreneur who figures this out will create value for marketers on par with what Marc Benioff has successfully done for the sales function.
